The project started with figuring out the pattern of online house hunting in Nigeria, Especially in Lagos. The hustle of searching for numerous apartment with beautiful images online but later discovered that the house is not what they expected it to be. Also, popular house hunting platforms in Lagos here always leave the communication with the agent to be outside the platform, this makes most house hunters be susceptible to extortion as the condition stated on their platform changes when they chat them up or even give them a call. This also makes reporting and monitoring of the agent's integrity almost impossible for these platforms. How about scammers that pose as agent on these platforms. Most of these users are not verified.",

It's like trying to find a needle in a haystack without a magnet.But fear not, because we're on a mission to change that narrative! We're not just talking about any old solution; we're talking about a game-changer, a platform that doesn't just bridge the gap but sparks a flame of connection that transcends borders, cultures, and beliefs.Picture this: Nigerian students coming together, not just to exchange pleasantries, but to share experiences, dreams, and aspirations. It's not just about networking; it's about building a tight-knit community that feels like family, regardless of where you're from or what you believe in.

Identity theft, particularly with debit cards, is a pressing concern, with Nigeria experiencing a significant rise in such incidents. According to recent data from the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS), there were over 20,000 reported cases of identity theft involving debit cards in the past year alone. This alarming trend poses a substantial risk to card payments, especially prevalent in online transactions, where users typically opt for card payments. However, the process often involves either storing the card details on the app (a daunting prospect) or tediously entering the lengthy PAN, expiry date, CVV, etc., even for small transactions as low as ₦1,000 (less than $1 USD).\n In-store payments present another challenge. While consumers prefer using cards for purchases at places like local eateries, malls, or convenience stores, issues arise when cards are forgotten at home or network failures occur, leading to declined transactions. Moreover, the inconvenience escalates when transferring funds between different banks, as recipients must wait for credit alerts. Why should users waste time waiting in stores to confirm payments? \nThis inconvenience extends to budding entrepreneurs seeking seamless payment solutions. They seek ways to receive payments without the stress associated with traditional methods. Smuut addresses these pain points, offering a solution for hassle-free financial transactions.",

This means, without the merchant receiving credit alert they won’t be able to checkout from the store. With the increase in debit card frauds in Nigeria, making payment in-store and online (with cards) seems to be a scary thing for customers. How about another means of payment that ensures the safety of the customer’s information. Various online stores limit the type of cards that can be used for checkout making web payment with card limited to few customer.",

The research receives response from over 30 participants who are active users of various online payments methods such as mobile app, USSD, etc. I took the response from the survey and further crafted out script which I used to interview 10 participant using their choice of virtual meeting platforms (Google meet, Teams call, and Zoom). The survey highlighted widespread concerns about debit card identity theft and frustrations with the cumbersome card payment process. Network reliability issues affected 38% of users, particularly in regions with unreliable connectivity. Additionally, 53% cited inter-bank transfer delays as a major pain point. These findings underscore the need to address these challenges to enhance the user experience and streamline financial transactions.",

This gives an alternative platform for users to make transactions in place of the regular mobile app. Most times, the organisations often neglect this channel when it comes to building an appealing interface for the users to access.

With this alone, it should represent the rich nature of the bank in terms of aesthetics and functionality. The Stanbic Ibank is not left out here. The interface looks terrible compare to the great reputation they have on the street. Talking of white space being thrown around aimlessly, to dull looking colours, down to poor navigations. This doesn't speak well of a multi-national bank. Also, it throws users into the state of Abido shaker",

Looks like it was designed by someone that just left a 3 weeks bootcamp. I am not saying it should have rainbows thrown around the screen but rather, let it pop. (b) Non-customers are not included as a prospective user of this platform. What if we allow them open an account so that they can partake in the goodies we have for them on IBANK.

The contact info is secured as customers will only see the contact when they log in and it is not the same for everybody. Users could see their loan debt, but there is no feature on the dashboard showing their eligibility and a prompt to further sell that service to them. Finally, the idea behind a dashboard is for the user to have an overview of their account and transactions.

        problemText: "One issue I feel we always ignore when creating ecommerce solutions is that we always focus on a specific type of users while ignoring the other type of users. You will agree with me that for an Ecommerce application like Jumia, there are two categories of Users. (a) the buyers (b) the seller. For a weird reason, when we think about this product, we always prioritize the buyers over the sellers. The payment, the user flows, the UX, the icon placement, the business behind the application are often times solely focused on the buyer. For instance, what happen when the product you picked and paid for on Jumia happen to be unavailable again after payment? The order will be canceled and refund will be sent to the buyer. No avenue for the Seller to upsell or suggest alternatives. Like I said, one sided focus. Another issue I found about Jumia and most Ecommerce applications (I sampled Jumia, Konga, Amazon, Ebay) is that you can't edit order (add to the quantity or change a variety like colour/size) after payment even before the shipping from the seller is done. What if there is a controlled means to be able to edit order in a way that won't affect the price. Let say change colour for products that have fixed price for all colours. This way, nothing is changing in terms of payments. Even if payment will be tampered, it should be limited to any change that cause INCREASE to price ONLY. Any change that leads to reduction in price will be at the loss of the buyer or will be sent to a wallet for future purchase",
        gettingStartedTexts: "Sampled over 14 known vendors on Jumia to know what they feel about the app in relation to my own detected issues. Also, I asked around both online and offline and I could get responses from 20 regular users of Jumia, 5 from 1-3 times users of Jumia and quite a number of them said something in relations to my concerns",
        snoopAroundTexts: "Of the 14 vendors contacted, 6 people talked aout how frustrating it could be for them not to be able to upsell to customers and most of the issues faced from their end always leads to order cancellation and a bad rating for them afterward. How about them having a means to communicate to buyers even if it is going to be controlled. They believe customers are not always fixated on a particular choice. An alternative could be accepted by the user",

        problemText: "The dating market is a jungle if you will agree with me. It's even worse when you involve social media or dating sites to foster your search. There are lots of issues such as long distance, mismatch of identity (more like what I ordered for vs what I get situation), Catfishing, time wasters, Hookup girls posing as a wife materials, etc. These and many more are what those who are genuinely searching for match online faces. Tinder is not excluded from this shit. In fact, it happens to be a major stakeholder of these issues. One of the major concern on this platform is time-waster, and catfishes. It will be great if users can checkmate this fishes before spending much time interacting with them. This project is just a short one to showcase the solution I'm suggesting to combat some of the issues I noticed on the Tinder app. To start with this project, I have to sign-up on the platform as a regular user. Let say I had to go and search actively for love. One issue I first noticed is the number of fake accounts posing as women. Another thing I noticed is the flow of things on the app especially when searchiing for genuine life partner. And the flow include: Get Matched, chat briefly and plan meetups, meet up and realize he/she have some defects that poses red flag to you. I did quite a lot of snooping which involve signing up for the platform, setting up my profile and swipped the hell out the cards. Now, here is the catch. I met quite a handful of people there. Some who are my padi now. But I noticed this drag with communication with these people which I believe would have been great if rather than text, A video call first would have ease the ground and also set as an examination for the new match",
